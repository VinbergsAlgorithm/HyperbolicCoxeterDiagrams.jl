* Drop more bad diagrams in `extend!_all_extensions` if possible
* make `extend!` into a non-recursive function

  
* More unit testing:
    * Test all functions on the one specific example already present
* Write `is_degenerate()` to check if the diagram is degenerate in the given rank

# Done

* Graph Isomorphism (the best approach is probably to use [Nauty.jl](https://github.com/bovine3dom/Nauty.jl/))
  (Done using LightGraphs's experimental graph isomorphism check)
